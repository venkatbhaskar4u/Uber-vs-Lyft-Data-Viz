# Uber vs. Lyft Data Visualization Project using Python

This GitHub repository contains a data visualization project that focuses on comparing the performance and popularity of the two leading ride-sharing services, Uber and Lyft. The project is implemented in Python and aims to provide insights into market share, pricing trends, user preferences, and the overall competitiveness of these two prominent companies in the ride-hailing industry.

## Motivation

As an international student in the US without a car, I relied heavily on ride-sharing and public transportation to navigate daily life. I developed this project to help myself and others estimate which ride-sharing service—Uber or Lyft—would be more cost-effective, reliable, or convenient at different times, locations, and ride types.  
By analyzing real trip data, I could objectively compare price, wait times, and coverage, empowering students and residents in similar situations to make smarter travel decisions and optimize their transportation budgets.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: The project acquires relevant data from reliable sources, such as public APIs, official reports, or publicly available datasets. It includes data related to ride fares, trip duration, driver ratings, customer reviews, service availability, and market coverage for both Uber and Lyft.

- **Data Preprocessing**: To ensure accurate and meaningful visualizations, the project emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing. This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging datasets, if necessary, to create a consistent and unified dataset for analysis.

- **Market Share Comparison**: The project provides visualizations to compare the market shares of Uber and Lyft. It includes pie charts, bar graphs, or line charts to showcase the relative market dominance of each company in different regions or over a specific time period.

- **Pricing Analysis**: The project explores the pricing strategies of Uber and Lyft by analyzing fare data. It visualizes fare distributions, surge pricing patterns, and price fluctuations during peak hours or events. This analysis allows for a comparison of pricing structures and helps identify any notable differences or similarities between the two services.

- **User Preferences**: The project investigates user preferences by analyzing customer reviews, ratings, and feedback data. It visualizes sentiment analysis results, word clouds, or stacked bar charts to illustrate customer perceptions and preferences towards Uber and Lyft, providing insights into areas of satisfaction and improvement for each company.

- **Geospatial Visualization**: The project utilizes geospatial data visualization techniques to map the service coverage areas of Uber and Lyft. It includes interactive maps, heatmaps, or choropleth maps to showcase the density of ride requests, driver availability, and the extent of service in different regions.

- **Time Series Analysis**: The project incorporates time series analysis to visualize and compare temporal trends in ride demand, driver availability, and service utilization for Uber and Lyft. This analysis can uncover patterns, seasonal variations, and growth trajectories for both companies.

- **Interactive Visualizations**: The project leverages interactive visualization libraries in Python to enhance the user experience and facilitate deeper exploration of the data. It includes interactive plots, filters, or sliders that allow users to interact with the visualizations and gain more granular insights.
## Value & Impact
These analyses can help businesses, city officials, and consumers better understand ride-sharing trends, optimize pricing strategies, and improve urban transportation planning.
